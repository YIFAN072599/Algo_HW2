Four most common strategies:

Market Making: Market makers provide liquidity by simultaneously quoting buy and sell prices for a financial instrument, profiting from the bid-ask spread. They help maintain an orderly market and facilitate trading. This strategy is prevalent in HFT as faster execution and lower latencies give market makers an advantage over competitors.

Statistical Arbitrage: This strategy exploits temporary price inefficiencies in related securities. HFT traders use statistical and machine learning models to identify pricing anomalies and capitalize on them. They may employ mean-reversion or pairs trading strategies to exploit these inefficiencies.

Momentum Ignition: This alpha strategy involves initiating a series of orders in an attempt to ignite a rapid price move in a specific direction. HFT firms use this strategy to trigger other market participants' stop-loss orders or encourage trend-following traders to join the momentum, allowing the HFT firm to profit from the resulting price movement.

Order Anticipation: This strategy involves detecting and predicting large institutional orders before they are executed. High-frequency traders use algorithms to analyze market data, such as order flow and volume, to predict the impact of these orders on prices and take positions accordingly.

Regarding "alpha" strategies, they are investment strategies that aim to generate returns that outperform the market (excess returns) by exploiting market inefficiencies, mispricing, or other unique insights. While statistical arbitrage and momentum trading can be considered alpha strategies, market making and order anticipation are more focused on exploiting structural or informational advantages rather than generating alpha.

Assumptions:

Market share: According to a 2020 report by the Financial Times, HFTs accounted for roughly 50% of the trading volume in the US equity market. While this percentage may have changed since then, we will assume it remains similar for our estimation.

Average daily trading volume: The average daily trading volume in the US equity market in recent years has been around $200 billion.

Profit per share: According to a 2012 paper by Baron, Brogaard, and Kirilenko, the average profit per share for HFTs was about 1 cent. Considering the increased competition and reduced margins in recent years, we'll assume a lower profit per share of 0.5 cents.

Leverage: HFTs typically use leverage to amplify their returns. However, the degree of leverage can vary significantly across firms and strategies. For our estimation, we'll assume an average leverage ratio of 5:1.

Estimation:

HFT daily trading volume: Assuming HFTs account for 50% of the total trading volume, their daily trading volume is approximately $100 billion ($200 billion * 0.5).

Number of shares traded: To estimate the number of shares traded by HFTs, we need to consider the average stock price. Let's assume an average stock price of $100. This implies that HFTs trade about 1 billion shares daily ($100 billion / $100).

Daily profit: With an assumed profit of 0.5 cents per share, the total daily profit for HFTs would be around $5 million (1 billion shares * $0.005).

Annual profit: Assuming 252 trading days in a year, the annual profit for HFTs would be approximately $1.26 billion ($5 million * 252).

Leveraged annual profit: Taking into account the assumed leverage ratio of 5:1, the leveraged annual profit for HFTs would be around $6.3 billion ($1.26 billion * 5).

Title: "The role of high-frequency traders and the flash crash: A systemic risk perspective"
Authors: Katsiaryna Pashkova, Cristina Mabel Scherrer-Schaub, and CÃ©line Gauthier
Journal: Journal of Financial Stability
Year: 2021

The paper investigates the role of high-frequency traders (HFTs) in the context of the Flash Crash of May 6, 2010, and explores the potential systemic risks associated with HFTs. The authors use a systemic risk perspective and apply different measures to analyze the potential impact of HFTs on the financial system.

Findings:
The paper finds that HFTs could have contributed to the Flash Crash by amplifying the price movements and generating higher intraday volatility. The authors also suggest that the interconnectedness between HFTs and other market participants might increase the risk of contagion and amplify the impact of shocks on the financial system. However, they emphasize that their findings are specific to the event and should not be generalized to all HFT activities or periods.

Agreement:
I generally agree with the findings of the paper. High-frequency trading can contribute to market instability and exacerbate price fluctuations, particularly during periods of high market stress. Additionally, the interconnectedness between HFTs and other market participants may indeed increase the potential for contagion and amplify the impact of shocks on the financial system. However, it is essential to recognize that these risks may not be universally applicable to all HFT activities or market conditions.

It is also worth noting that HFTs can have positive effects on market functioning, such as providing liquidity, reducing bid-ask spreads, and improving market efficiency. Therefore, it is crucial to consider both the potential risks and benefits associated with high-frequency trading when evaluating its overall impact on the financial system.

Strategy: Order Book Imbalance 

Description:
The OBI strategy aims to exploit short-term price movements based on imbalances in the order book. It is based on the assumption that a significant imbalance between bid and ask orders can indicate buying or selling pressure, leading to temporary price changes in the direction of the imbalance.

Methodology and Data:
To research this strategy, we would use historical intraday order book data (including bid and ask sizes at various price levels) and trade data. The data would be sourced from financial data providers like Nasdaq TotalView, BATS, or other similar platforms.

Data Preparation: Collect historical intraday order book data, including bid and ask sizes at various price levels, for a universe of stocks for the past several years. Also, obtain intraday trade data (e.g., 1-minute or 5-minute intervals) for the same period.

Feature Engineering: Calculate the order book imbalance as the difference between the bid and ask sizes divided by the total order size (bid + ask) at a specific price level or aggregated over a range of price levels.

Order Book Imbalance (OBI) = (Bid Size - Ask Size) / (Bid Size + Ask Size)

Signal Generation: Identify instances where the OBI exceeds a predefined threshold (positive or negative), indicating a significant buying or selling pressure. Generate a long (short) signal when the OBI is above (below) the threshold, expecting a short-term price movement in the direction of the imbalance.

Backtesting: Using the S&P 500 data, and trade as the signal we designed.Implement the strategy in a backtesting framework, entering positions based on the generated signals and closing them after a predefined holding period or when the OBI reverts to a neutral level. Measure the strategy's performance using various metrics, including the Sharpe ratio. Also, we would change the parameters in the strategy(threshold), to test the robustness of the strategy.
